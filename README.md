I'm an automation engineer and researcher on evolvable hardware but what I really do for a living is learning. Many professionals I worked with consider myself a fast and deep learner.
Since I was very young I enjoyed investigating how many devices worked. Curiosity drove me to learn at first Assembly and C++ programming languages.
Many years later I became an electronics technician and eventually an automation engineer. I avoid limiting my skills to my work and academic titles, expanding my knowledge beyond what is expected from me, towards a lifelong objective of understanding, coordinating and infusing intelligence into processes and matter.
